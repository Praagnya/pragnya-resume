        Developing agentic RAG systems that integrate information from diverse sources (web, PubMed, podcasts etc) to reduce
        hallucination and provide factually grounded response for health literacy.

        Developed an LLM-orchestrated pipeline that clones OSS repos, classifies files, and auto-generates runnable code examples
        executed in cloud-container with iterative self-debugging and LLM-as-judge validation, producing reproducible artifacts,
        logs, and cost telemetry.

        Designed and implemented a CodeRAG for scientific claims that ranks/reranks repos via embeddings + LLM, assembles
        targeted context, executes code, and evaluates outcomes programmatically, enabling automated claim verification.

        Built a containerized execution framework that spins up sandboxed environments, automates dependency installation,
        clones repos, and captures stdout/stderr/pip logs; parallelized workloads with threading to improve throughput.

        Developed MARRV (Multi-Agent Reflective Reasoning with Verifiable Rewards), a novel framework combining
        Chain-of-Rubrics LLM evaluation with Reflexion feedback loops, improving multi-step mathematical reasoning and
        reward-aligned decision making in transformer-based agents.

        Re-engineered a published Symbolic Deep Reinforcement Learning (SDRL) framework by refactoring its Montezuma's
        Revenge implementation into a modular, scalable neuro-symbolic architecture, upgrading from Python 2 + TensorFlow to
        Python 3.9 + PyTorch to enable reproducibility and integration with deep RL workflows.

        Built a real-time analytics pipeline using Apache Kafka and 50TB+ Amazon S3 Storage, enabling page-level brand safety
        classification using content metadata and NLP signals aligned with the GARM category taxonomy.

        Collaborated with Fraud Team to improve IVT (Invalid Traffic) detection accuracy by 18%, enabling cross-channel
        expansion via cross-device signal aggregation, time-series drift handling, and automated retraining workflows.

        Improved ad performance by 12–15% CTR uplift through content-matched inventory curation, semantic scoring, and brand
        suitability filtering.

        Developed more than 50 custom audience segments for brand targeting based on fraud scores, context, and user behavior,
        enhancing the precision of the ad by 15%.

        Collaborated with the Threat Lab team to detect zero-day fraud patterns through unsupervised clustering, graph-based
        anomaly detection, and human-in-the-loop validation.

        Supported incident response by resolving 30+ model scoring issues, using prediction logs and confidence thresholds to
        identify root causes, and initiating retraining workflows via MLflow and automated CI/CD triggers.
